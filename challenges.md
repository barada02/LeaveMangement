- Added input validation for required fields
- Improved JSON response formatting
- Added detailed error logging for debugging

### 3. Employee List Loading Issues
**Challenge:** Employee list not displaying when page loads.
**Solution:**
- Fixed API response format in `get_employees.php`
- Implemented proper JSON structure with status, message, and data
- Added null value handling for optional fields
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed date formatting for consistency

## Frontend Integration Challenges

- Sanitized error messages for production
- Added structured error responses
- Separated development and production error handling

## Code Organization and Maintenance

### 1. Code Structure
**Challenge:** Disorganized code making maintenance difficult.
**Solution:**
- Separated configuration into `config.php`
- Created modular API endpoints
- Implemented consistent error handling patterns
- Added proper documentation and comments

### 2. Debugging and Testing
**Challenge:** Difficulty in identifying and fixing issues.
**Solution:**
- Created test scripts for API endpoints
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Implemented debugging tools and utilities
- Added response logging for troubleshooting

## Recent Development Challenges (December 2024)

### 1. Leave Balance Initialization Issue
**Challenge:** Leave balance was not being created for newly registered employees, causing errors in leave management operations.
**Solution:**
- Added leave balance initialization within the employee registration transaction
- Created variables for bind_param to handle constant values
- Implemented proper error handling for leave balance creation
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Database Parameter Binding Issue
**Challenge:** Error with mysqli_stmt::bind_param when trying to use constants directly.
**Solution:**
- Created intermediate variables to store constant values
- Modified the bind_param implementation to use variables instead of constants
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging
- Maintained transaction integrity throughout the process

### 3. API Response Structure Enhancement
**Challenge:** Need for separate notifications for employee registration and leave balance initialization.
**Solution:**
- Restructured API response to include separate status sections
- Added detailed leave balance information in the response
- Improved error handling and status reporting
- Included leave details (sick, casual, earned, festival) in response

### 4. Navigation Enhancement
**Challenge:** Users were unable to navigate back to the home page from the login page.
**Solution:**
- Added navigation functionality to the company logo
- Implemented proper linking to index.php
- Added hover effects for better user experience
